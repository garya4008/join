    <p>
      In a landmark international investigation, law enforcement authorities have successfully seized more than <strong>$430 million</strong> in cryptocurrency assets stolen by <strong>NexVault</strong>, a now-defunct digital asset management firm accused of defrauding thousands of investors worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
      The investigation, which spanned 14 countries and involved cooperation from blockchain analytics firms, uncovered an elaborate scheme where NexVault executives misused customer funds for personal enrichment and high-risk investments. Following multiple indictments and the arrest of co-founders <strong>Marcus Elridge</strong> and <strong>Dina Kowalski</strong>, prosecutors announced today that the first phase of asset recovery has begun.

      "This is a major victory for digital asset investors and demonstrates that crypto crime is not beyond the reach of law," said FBI cybercrimes division spokesperson <strong>Alan Chen</strong>. Recovery teams are now verifying identities of affected clients who may be eligible for partial restitution as early as September 2025.

      Authorities urge anyone who invested in NexVault between 2022 and 2024 to register with the official claims portal at  
      <a href="https://recovery-crypto.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://recovery-crypto.gov</a>  
      (portal opens August 15).

      Investigators also noted that funds were traced using AI-driven analytics across multiple blockchains, making this case a model for future efforts against decentralized fraud.
